* Files

** ~data~ subdirectory

These are the raw input data.

** ~src~ subdirectory

Scripts to parse the input data and generate inputs in the required
format. Ongoing work.

** ~railway_solvers~ subdirectory

These are the actual solvers. A test can be run like that:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 -m pytest
#+END_SRC
in this directory. The ~railway_solvers~ subdirectory (same name as
its parent) is the solver module.
