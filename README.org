** ~data~ subdirectory

These are the raw input data.

** ~data_formatting~ subdirectory

Scripts to parse the input data and generate inputs in the required
format.

A test can be run like that:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 -m pytest
#+END_SRC
in this directory. The ~data_formatting~ subdirectory (same name as
its parent) is the parser module.

** ~railway_solvers~ subdirectory

These are the actual solvers. A test can be run like that:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
python3 -m pytest
#+END_SRC
in this directory. The ~railway_solvers~ subdirectory (same name as
its parent) is the solver module.
