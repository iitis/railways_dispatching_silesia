Train schedule is in file: '''train_schedule.csv''', the '''train_schedule_1.csv''' is somehow modified schedule for some initial play with re-routing.

The infrastructure (all possible connection of blocks with passing times is in '''KZ-KO-KL-CB_paths.ods''').

Network diagram is in '''railway_network_detailed.pdf''', or the more updated version in article on overlief.

##################### '''train_schedule.csv''' ###########################

First column consist of:

####
company - train type,
train number (unique)
train name or line (not unique)
starting point of the train (within or outside analysed network part)
blocks within analysed network part (multi row)
ending point of the train

blocks are in string divided onto station blocks and line blocks:

station blocks: "station symbol", "ST" or "ST-M", track n.o. "(platform n.o.)"

line block: "one_station-otner_station", "SBL", track id, "block id.", "(number of blocks between stations)"

"SBL" is the symbol of blocking system, may be others

"SBL + PO ..." - the stop within the block

"SBL + sem(ST)" - a station entrance / leaving signal.


more details in ```block_description.txt```

Block strings are unique, what is used it train's path comparison.

Block rows correspond with following columns:

speed: IC or R -- it is then used in infrastructure file to read the passing time of the train's type
There are sometimes semi-fast trains that has R for the part of the trip and IC for the part.

Arr- scheduled arrival time in minute precision
Dep - scheduled departure time in minute precision
Approx_enter - estimated from timetable arrival time, for shunting or if the train does not stop
e.g. KZ case

Label- stations or stop names

Shunting - yes if train enter the block during shunting

Turnaround_time_minutes - additional stay if train turn around at this block

Particular blocks:

"KO(IC)", "B-M", 500, "(N/A)", "Rac(KS)", "B-M", 200, "(N/A)", "KO", "ST-M", 1113, "(N/A)", "KO", "ST-M", 1114, "(N/A)", "KO", "ST-M", 1118, "(N/A)"
- these are depots, here one do not check for one train on the block

If two trains has the similar number, such as at one there is 9 added at the end, they share the same rolling stock and the one with 9 is the shunting.

######################### '''KZ-KO-KL-CB_paths.ods''' ##########################

All possible trains paths. Colours correspond to particular station or lines.

Columns: previous_block next_block are two neighbours blocks

Column: direction is the corresponding station or line

Columns: default_A-B, Y / N / X - if Y going previous_block -&gt; next_block is possible and it is default (usual) setting of the network; if N going previous_block -&gt; next_block is possible but it is not-default (unusual) setting of the network; if X going previous_block -&gt; next_block is not possible

Column default_B-A the same but for going previous_block <- next_block

Column: switches - numbers of switches to be passed within station if going previous_block -&gt; next_block or previous_block <- next_block. Numbers are unique within given station. If no switches e.g. for line block N/A

Column: time_inter_city_A-B passing time of train with mark IC from previous_block to next_block. It correspond passing of whole previous_block (from entrance signal) to entrance signal of next_block. Minimal stay at station is included here is occurs (it should be occasionally enlarged by Turnaround_time_minutes if appears in train's path).

Column: time_inter_city_B-A passing time of train with mark IC from next_block next_block. It correspond passing of whole next_block !!! (from entrance signal) to entrance signal of previous_block.

Notation previous_block next_block are from first two columns not train direction.

Columns: time_regional_train_A-B and time_regional_train_B-A the same but for trains marked as regional, (in general additional stops ate accounted for).
